##Summary

This is a reminder app which fingerprints speakers by ambient sound and recognises them with a machine learning algorithm. It's basically a practical implementation of a classifier.

At the moment, this app only reminds you that you wanted to speak with certain persons. Coming soon is the ability to associate each person with a specific conversation topic!
